## Task
Given a hand-drawn image:
- Extract all relevant drawable structures using image processing.
- Apply necessary transformations and corrections (e.g., homography).
- Display meaningful visual outputs for each major step.

## Requirements
Your script should visualize:
- The original image
- Preprocessed image (e.g., thresholded or binarized)
- Edge or contour detections
- Skeletonized or thinned paths
- Final processed image with drawable paths overlaid

## Deliverables
- A Google Colab notebook or Python script
- Output figures for each stage of processing
- Dedicate a small section of the notebook describing the process through which the solution was arrived

## Disclaimer
- The processes outlined in the requirements are not the only ones that must be used in the solution, they provide a basic framework to guide you. The main focus should be on extracting the most optimal path from the given input image.
